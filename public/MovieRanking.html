<h1>Chris's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My Favorite Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Prince of Egypt</h3>
<p>A beautiful story still true today.</p>

<h3>The Ten Commandments</h3>
<p>A timeless retelling of the story of Moses.</p>

<h3>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</h3>
<p>Both philosophical and engaging action scenes are displayed in this movie.
    What does it mean to be human? What is our nature? Are those who follow us
    doomed to repeat our mistakes?
